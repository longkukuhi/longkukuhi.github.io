Currently, I am an assistant professor at the College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University.  My research primarily focuses on artificial intelligence (AI) for the development of novel multi-modal (text+image) learning techniques, with a particular emphasis on the research of large language models at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.  My research track record is distinguished by 12 peer-reviewed full papers as first-author, published in prestigious conferences and journals, such as ECCV (h5-index 238, CORE A*), SIGIR (h5-index 103, CORE A*), ICRA (h5-index 122, CORE A*), ICASSP (h5-index 129).
