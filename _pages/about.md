Please note that my website is under construction. Will be finished very soon!
My research primarily focuses on artificial intelligence (AI) for the development of novel multi-modal (text+image) learning techniques, with a particular emphasis on the employment of large language models at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.  My research track record is distinguished by 8 peer-reviewed full papers as first-author,  published in prestigious conferences and journals, such as ICRA (h5-index 119, CORE A*), ICASSP (h5-index 123), and DATE (h5-index 49). Over the past three years, I have enriched my academic and leadership skills by serving as an MSc Project Supervisor, Tutor, and Marking Assistant at the University of Glasgow. My commitment to the field extends to my active participation as a Program Committee member and reviewer for leading conferences like AAAI (h5-index 212, CORE A*), ECCV (h5-index 238, CORE A*), and notably as a proceedings chair for BMVC (h5-index 77, CORE A). This experience demonstrates my commitment to advancing the community, showcasing my proficiency in academic writing and ability to effectively present our contributions to the field.
