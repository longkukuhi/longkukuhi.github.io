I am PhD candidate in the University of Glasgow. My research primarily focuses on deep learning with multi-modal data (images and text), focusing on the innovative use of large language models at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.  My research track record is distinguished by 8 peer-reviewed papers published in prestigious conferences and journals, such as ICRA, ICASSP, DATE, and ISCRAM, complemented by 4 additional papers currently under peer review. This record not only showcases my proficiency in academic writing but also highlights my ability to effectively present our contributions to the field. Additionally, over the past three years, I have enriched my academic and leadership skills by serving as an MSc Project Supervisor, tutor, and marking assistant at the University of Glasgow. My commitment to the field extends to my active participation as a Program Committee (PC) member and reviewer for leading conferences like AAAI, ECCV, and ISCRAM, and notably as a proceedings chair for BMVC. This rich experience underscores my commitment to the advancement of the community.
